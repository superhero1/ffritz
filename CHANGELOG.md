Change history of application package
=====================================

Next
----
- mpd 0.20.5 -> 0.20.18
- mpdclient 2.9 -> 2.11
- Bluetooth btstack Apr 10 2018 [0a42fd2391f2ec0205a46de679e23220490c6da8]
- libupnp 1.15 -> 1.16
- upmpdcli 1.12 -> 1.16
- Option for DVB-C to speed up rtp packet transimission. Make it multi-threaded.

Release 6
---------
- Added gdb, gdbserver, ltrace
- Added DVB-C transport stream forwarding to offload Atom CPU.
  See README-dvb.txt

Release 5
---------
- lirc: Eliminate endless loop when disconnecting irtoy at runtime
- usbplayd: Finally support different discrete sample rates of endpoints (somehow)
	- sndlist lists all supported rates
	- adding "-r 44100" to usbplayd.conf avoinds resampling (if endpoint supports it)
	- Some (my) endpoint report an error if the rate request command is sent, but do it
	  anyhow correctly, so error is ignored.
- bluetooth:
	- store session/pairing data persistently in /var/media/ftp/ffritz/bt
- Remove 100s startup delay unless box is booting

Release 4
---------
- Fix tmpfs memory leak: fflogrotate got lost along the way,
  /var/log/ffritz.log could become big over time.
- Fix upmpdcli startup issue
- Limit logrotate backup to 250K
- ffdaemon: can be stopped with SIGTERM, will reap worker
- Added etc/ffshutdown
- Added -u option to etc/usrmount

Release 3
---------
- Add 100 second startup angst delay.
  ffritz services (USB, OpenVPN) get in conflict with fb startup,
  especially on 6.85.

Release 2
---------
- Fix irexec (failed to execute commands due to wrong sh path)
- Updated libusb version to 1.0.21
- Started Bluetooth support
	- Requires updating /var/media/ftp/ffritz/usbplayd.conf
	  with

    USBPLAYD_ARGS=-P /var/tmp/mpd.fifo:44100 -P /var/tmp/shairport.fifo:44100 -P /var/tmp/bt.fifo:44100

Release 1
---------
- Renamed from release 14 of combined core/application release
- Re-packaged as squashfs binary to be installed using ffinstall

TODO
----
- Bluetooth
	- Play pipe should not be opened until playback
	  starts.
	- Provide proper pairing (e.g. only when pressing
	  WPS button..)


Change history of ffritz core integration:
==========================================

release 18
-------------------------------
- Various fixes to build system
- Auto-load source/binary images.
- Update to AVM source version 6.87
- Atom: Always rebuild kernel modules (cdc-acm)
- Add make help
- Add make targets for rebuilding packages and overwriting pre-built binaries.
- Properly build and install be squashfstools from freetz
- dropbear 2016.74 -> 2018.76
- prepare openssh

release 17
-------------------------------
- Fix permission of / directory to 755 to make dropbear happy
- Makefile: integrate arm image from build directory if it exists
- Tested with firmware 6.87

release 16
-------------------------------
- Tested Firmware 6.85
	- Update might require re-enabling the OpenVPN
  	  forwarding rule.

release 15 
-------------------------------
- Add support for Firmware 6.83
- Arm
	- Don't start temporary telnetd any more
	- Don't invoke atom startup
- Atom
	- Application tarball is no longer integrated into root
	  filesystem
		- Replaced by sqaushfs image mounted at startup
		  (/var/media/ftp/ffritz/data/ffimage.bin)
		- Only if sha256 checksum matches
	- Support for 6.83 (older versions no longer tested)
	- Replace nvram access by an encrypted storage on the nas
		(/var/media/ftp/ffritz/data/ffstore.dat)
		- Runtime copy is in /tmp/ffnvram
		- Added nvsync tool to store current state of
		  ffnvram to ffstore
		- Lacking a ffstore.dat, ffnvram is populated
		  traditionally from /nvram
	- Dropbear, openssl and telnetd are part of default
	  squashfs install image.
	- Start temporary telnetd
	- mpd
		- add libnfs support
	- usrmount/.mtab
		- uses fuse-nfs (kernel no longer supports nfs).
		- The options field in .mtab has changed and needs
		  to be adjusted:
		  It is the servers URI in libnfs format
		  (nfs://server/share), followed by additional options
		  for fuse-nfs.
	- added openssl binary
	- add build of privatekeypassword
	- Change license of source to GPLv3 to be compatible with
	  apache code

release 14
----------
- Atom
	- Add OpenVPN (experimental). See OPENVPN.md

- Arm
	- Add counter support to athtool
	- Add pswtool to access internal Puma6 L2 switch

release 13
----------
- Atom
	- buildroot
		- New gcc version (4.7.3 -> 4.9.3)
		- New binutils version (2.21.1 -> 2.23.1)
			- Host gcc 4.7 no longer required
	- New mpd version (0.19.21 -> 0.20.5)
		- mpd/upmpdcli now support LPCM/l16 audio format
- Arm
	- version 0.3 of arm package
		- added gdbserver
		- Added athtool to access box switch

release 12
----------
- Atom
	- Added upmpdcli
		- UPNP/DLNA renderer front-end for mpd
		- l16/LPCM audio is currently not supported
		  (would require latest mpd, which does not compile in this
		  toolchain)
	- Auto-start irexec
	- Moved irexec config file to /var/media/ftp/ffritz/irexec.lircrc

release 11
----------
- Atom
	- lirc
		- switch back to main lirc repository
		- replaced irdroid driver with fixed irtoy
		  NOTE: _This requires replacing/merging existing
		  lirc_options.conf with etc/lirc_options_dfl.conf!_
		- lircd sometimes crashed after the very first start.
		  Workaround is to start it in self-respawning mode
		  (via ffdaemon).
	- usbplayd
		- Fix hanging daemon
	- added ffdaemon script to start service as daemon
	- some startup/daemon output is logged to /var/tmp/ffritz.log,
	  added simple logrotate

	- Forward dropbear stderr outputs to /dev/console
	- Create ssh symlink to dbclient
	- Added curl binary
	- Added rsync binary
- ARM
	- Make sure that ssh stuff and passwords in /nvram are not cleared
	  when a factory reset is performed (by means of entries in 
	  /etc/docsis/nvramdontremove). Only for FW 6.6x and later.
	- Do not apply ipv6 patch for 6.63 and later
	- Added Makefile option to integrate separate arm package into root
	  filesystem (ffritz-arm-XX.tar.gz, see below).
- Make sure directory permissions for /var/media/ftp/ffritz are correct

release 8
---------

	- Added some tools:
	  strace
	  ldd
	  tcpdump
	  tcpreplay
	  su
	  mpc

	  several inputs. It also performs sample rate conversion if required.
	- Accordingly, mpd uses fifo output driver instead of pipe driver

	- Added user mount table (var/media/ftp/ffritz/.mtab)
- ARM

release 6
---------
- Store/move dropbear keys to /nvram
- Kill telnetd after 5 minutes
- Do not start telnetd on atom by default
- Remove execution of /var/flash/debug.cfg
- Add ssh as symlink to dbclient
- Add /.ssh as symlink to /var/tmp/root-ssh, and 
  link this to nvram at startup
- Repack telnet-1.tar with busybox (same for release image)

release 5
---------
- Support for 6.62

release 4
---------
- IPV6 native tested, seems to work
- Better dropbear integration, ssh daemon started by default

release 2 [fb6490_6.50_telnet-2.tar]
