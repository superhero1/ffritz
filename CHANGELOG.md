=====================================

NEXT
====
- Merge with 6490 Branch (work in progress, not tested)
 - Select URL in conf.mk should build an image for legacy (7.12) and
   7.20 (completely untested)
 - Toolchain build works

 - TODO

----------------
- Add setrlimit options to ffdaemon.
- usrmount: Try to create mount directory before mounting
- tvheadend: apply stack and memory limit via ffdaemon
- ffservice: add edit, config and purge option.
  Adapted default service files.
- buildroot: now using ffservice configuration file.
  Old file (ffbuildroot.conf) is transferred.
- usbplayd: now using ffservice configuration file.
  Old config file (usbplayd.conf) no longer used.
- mpd: service supports options to disable ympd/upmpdcli
- bluetooth: can set AP name in config options.

Release puma7-15
----------------
- Buildroot version 2020-02 (only for FritzOS 7.19 onwards)
	- Add support for different buildroot versions living alongside.
	  (see [conf.mk.tpl](conf.mk.tpl))
	- Add PARALLEL option to conf.mk to perform buildroot parallel build.
- Add non-ELF binaries from buildroot usr/(s)bin to /usr/local/bin.
- tvheadend: Added patch/support for buildroot-2020.02
- shairport-sync: version 3.3.5

Release puma7-14
----------------
- Don't activate any service except buildroot on a fresh installation
- Fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH for ff wrapper (required for 7.19)
- ffimage=0 option in kernel_args EFI parameter will prevent application 
  image startup.

ISSUES
- wireguard
	- Kernel panic in 7.13 on "ip link up", will not load here
	- Same on 7.19, so kernel module will not be built

Release puma7-13
----------------
- linux kernel modules
	- no longer required (cdc-acm part of FritzOS)
- Remove athtool
- use AVM kernel/defconfig (from rootfs) for building modules
- Add wireguard service, module, wg-quick and wg tool
- Replace/fix shairport with shairport-sync
- Added nfs server (user space unfsd).
- Buildroot: The /var filesystem is now a unionfs with ramdisk instead of nvram.


Release 12
----------
- Add feature to buildroot to use FS overlay on flash
	- Configuration file /tmp/ffnvram/ffbuildroot.conf
	- Parameter BR_USER_OVERLAY
		Specifies directory to be used as writable
		overlay for the whole root filesystem /tmp/br
- Buildroot service script kills all chrooted processes before
  unmounting.
- Bump buildroot version to buildroot-2019.05-rc2
- Fix syntax error buildroot userconfig target
- Added/changed some default buildroot settings:
	- Python options and default packages:
		PYTHON3_PY_PYC
		PYTHON3_CURSES
		PYTHON3_SSL
		PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS
		PYTHON_PIP

	- Added
		DOSFSTOOLS
		DOSFSTOOLS_FATLABEL
		DOSFSTOOLS_FSCK_FAT
		DOSFSTOOLS_MKFS_FAT
		E2FSPROGS
		E2FSPROGS_RESIZE2FS
		EXFAT
		EXFAT_UTILS
		F2FS_TOOLS
		SSHFS
		BWM_NG
		ETHTOOL
		FPING
		NMAP_NMAP
		SUDO
		HTOP

- TODO
	Add (buildroot service) option to relocate a USB storage as
	overlay so that it is not exposed via /var/media/ftp.

Release 11
----------
- Fix kernel header version for toolchain
  (caused some issues in chroot environment)

Release 10
----------
- Use latest buildroot (2016.05 -> snapshot 20190428)
	- Tons of new versions

- Application package
	- Added ympd http frontend for mpd (port 82)
	- Added list/restart options to ffservice
	- Minor stuff for new buildroot
	- Simplified OpenVPN setup. Forwarding rule is now applied
	  automatically (pcplisten) without having to define one in the 
	  FritzOS GUI.

	- INCOMPATIBILITIES
		- OpenVPN : the OpenVPN.conf file needs to be changed:
		  In /tmp/ffnvram/root-ssh/openvpn, change "local" from
		  
		  192.168.178.253   (or whatever was configured)

		  to the main address of the box (e.g. 192.168.178.1)

- TODO
	- ARM tools with new buildroot

Release 9
---------
- Application package
	- Added basic service mechanism (See README-APP.md)
	- Added "buildroot" service to have buildroot available as chroot
	  environment.
		- in /usr/local/buildroot
		- init script will make chroot-able fs in /tmp/br
		- ramdisc overlay with unionfs-fuse
		- experimental, far goal is to use buildroot for all
		  services
	- mpd: Enhanced Recorder plugin
		- "parent" property will create a recorder instance
		  which just tells named instance to copy current
		  title to archive_path
		- archive_path: like format_path, will copy current
		  title there when told by a client instance to do so.
		- delete_after_record: Delete current title after
		  recording it.
	  The purpose is to be able to capture the complete title that
	  is currently playing by:
	  - Continuously running an instance with "delete_after_record"
	  - only save the title when toggling the run state of an
	    instance with a "parent" attribute (stop->start).
	- DVB-C: Some adaptions to wrapper library, looks now stable.
	- Change startup/service scripts
		- now in /tmp/ffnvram/etc/inid.d, linked to etc/rc.d
		  for execution
		- can be changed and saved with nvstore

 - TODO
 	- libdvbfi: sometimes stops working after closing stream
		- FOS 7.02: MIGHT CRASH THE BOX!
		- FOS 7.08 Labor: Seems stable

Release 8 (FritzOS7 only)

  See README-dvb.txt

Release 5
---------
- lirc: Eliminate endless loop when disconnecting irtoy at runtime
- usbplayd: Finally support different discrete sample rates of endpoints (somehow)
	- sndlist lists all supported rates
	- adding "-r 44100" to usbplayd.conf avoinds resampling (if endpoint supports it)
	- Some (my) endpoint report an error if the rate request command is sent, but do it
	  anyhow correctly, so error is ignored.
- bluetooth:
	- store session/pairing data persistently in /var/media/ftp/ffritz/bt
- Remove 100s startup delay unless box is booting

Release 4
---------
- Fix tmpfs memory leak: fflogrotate got lost along the way,
  /var/log/ffritz.log could become big over time.

Release 1
---------
- Renamed from release 14 of combined core/application release
- Re-packaged as squashfs binary to be installed using ffinstall

TODO
----
- Bluetooth
	- Play pipe should not be opened until playback
	  starts.
	- Provide proper pairing (e.g. only when pressing
	  WPS button..)


Change history of ffritz core integration:
==========================================

release 27
----------
- [7.19] Add ffritz.target after multi-user.target to prevent services from starting too early
- Add /nvram/ffnvram/etc/hotplug/udev-mount-sd hook to control where USB storage devices
  are mounted to. This is meant to replace the "remount" service.

release 26
----------
- Removed oem.patch
- Add method for user to add own patches by simply copying them
  as user-*.patch into the atom/arm subfolder.

release 25
----------
- Add support for ARM toolchain/application image.

release 24
----------
- Add support for Lab Firmware 7.19
	- New init system
	- kernel 4.9.175
- Add Makefile option to enable console
- Move configurable make settings to conf.mk
- uimg tool: Partition files names can be without content identifier.
- ffimage=0 option in kernel_args EFI parameter will prevent mounting of 
  image startup.

TODO

release 23
----------
- Toolchain
	- buildroot
		- Use Release 2019.05
		- change to glibc from uClibc.
			- Use same as AVM (2.23) to avoid two different
			  libc's (LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not work for libc).
	- uimg: Fix help message
- privatekeypassword
	- remove check for uClibc
- Adapt rc scripts
	- dont use md5 hash any more
- Adapt switch_bootbank script
- Change atom squashfs options: set xz compression, bfs export, no xattrs
- Statically linked busybox/telnetd for now
- application package must contain glibc-version file to distinct from uclibc image
- Force firmware_version to avm
- Force CONFIG_RTL=y
- Move "nvram" to /nvram filesystem.
	The nvram used to be an encrypted tar file extracted to /tmp/ffnvram.
	It is now located in /nvram/ffnvram, which is a ext4 filessytem on
	the eMMC (ca. 5MB free). The startup script migrates the existing
	data to /nvram and uses it from there on.
        nvsync is no longer necessary but can still be called.


release 22
----------
- Atom: Fix initial telnetd and ssh login with password authentication.
- ARM: New binaries for buildroot snapshot 20190428
- ARM: added more tools to base image:
	tcpdump etc, gdb, gdbserver, ltrace, strace

release 21
----------

!! broken, no telnetd, no ssh password auth

- Use latest buildroot (2016.05 -> snapshot 20190428)
  Tons of new versions ..
  	- openssl changed to 1.1.0
	  default message digest is changed here from md5 to sha256. To keep
	  nvram accessible between version changes i still use md5 for now,
	  but this might eventually change. 
	  This image supports both for decrypting nvram.

release 20
----------
- Fix startup issue on FRITZOS 7.02 when previously no ffritz was installed.
- Do not download ARM extension package by default
- Init script /etc/init.d/S97-ffusr executes /tmp/ffnvram/etc/rc.user, if
  it exists.

release 19
----------
- Support for FritzOS 7 (only)
	- New buildroot toolchain -> new uClibc etc. ->
		all binaries incompatible to previous versions

	- Support for 6.83 (older versions no longer tested)
	- Replace nvram access by an encrypted storage on the nas
		(/var/media/ftp/ffritz/data/ffstore.dat)
		- Runtime copy is in /tmp/ffnvram
		- Added nvsync tool to store current state of
		  ffnvram to ffstore
		- Lacking a ffstore.dat, ffnvram is populated
		  traditionally from /nvram
	- Dropbear, openssl and telnetd are part of default
	  squashfs install image.

	- Do not apply ipv6 patch for 6.63 and later
	- Added Makefile option to integrate separate arm package into root
