## Template for integrating "3rd prty" tool
##
## Tool specific options for configuring, building and installing 
## are listed in ../../package.mk
##
## By default,
## - tarball/git repository is downloaded (../../url-mypackage or ../../git-mypackage must exist)
## - extracted/cloned below "build",
## - patched with all .patch files located here
## - configured according to CONFTYPE
## - built below build
## - installed (make install) according to INSTALL_ rules
##
## make clean deletes the build directory
##
## To integrate the build result into the application package, add
## this to ../ffritz/Makefile:
##
## INSTDIRS   += ../mypackage/install
##
## Missing libraries etc. should first be searched for in buildroot and
## added via "make userconfig" there.
